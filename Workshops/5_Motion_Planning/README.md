# Motion Planning Workshop

## Summary

In this workshop we will use Webots to simulate the implementation of popular sampling-based motion planning algorithms like RRT, RRT*and PRM. This workshop aims at using these algorithms to find solutions in environments with varying obstacle density and also plot relevant graphs to compare algorithms.

## Requirements

1. Download and install Webots here: https://cyberbotics.com/
2. Download the motion planning files for this repo: 
   - rrt_star.wbt
   - rrt_puck.py
   - rrt_supervisor.py
3. During the workshop I will show you where to place these files and how to run them.

# Participatory Robot Design

## Summary 

The goal of this workshop is to explore strategies for user involvement in the development of robotics platforms. Involving users in the design of robots can streamline research and product development, by reducing the number of iterations required to build culturally relevant and flexible platforms that users understand.

## Setup

None! Just show up and be ready to learn!

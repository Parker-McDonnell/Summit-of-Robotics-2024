# Mechatronics Workshop

## Summary
In this workshop, we will provide an overview of how to design a robot in real life. We will go over how to select components (motors, microcontrollers, pre-manufactured components, etc.), where to buy/acquire components, different manufacturing techniques, and more. At the end of the workshop we will play a system design game were we will build robotic systems out of block diagrams to achieve required specifications. These designs will be discussed as groups.

## Setup

None! Just show up and be ready to have fun.

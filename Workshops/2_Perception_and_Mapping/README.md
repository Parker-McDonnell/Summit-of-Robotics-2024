# Perception and Mapping Workshop

## Summary

In this workshop, we will explore how onboard cameras and vision based techniques can be used for autonomous navigation, mapping, and hazard detection for space exploration missions. We will focus on asteroid missions as a case study. First, we will briefly review several perception algorithms, such as using surface shadows for hazard detection and the asteroid’s silhouette for 3D-shape reconstruction. We will then implement a technique based on visual point clouds to perform navigation and surface mapping while orbiting an asteroid, using MATLAB. The workshop will end with a fun challenge: trying to perform the so-called “loop closure” to refine the reconstructed asteroid shape model.

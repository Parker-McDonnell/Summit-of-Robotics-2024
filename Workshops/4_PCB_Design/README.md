# PCB Design Workshop

We will provide an overview of key techniques in PCB design and fabrication, from selecting suitable electrical components to best practices in soldering and measuring in on-load assembly. Participants will explore how to design a functional H-bridge build it to control the motor in both direction. The hands-on activity will guide attendees through the creation of a simple PCB circuit, including the design, drawing schematic by software and testing processes. 

## Setup

### Installing Arduino IDE

```
Step 1. Download and Install the latest version of Arduino IDE according to your operating system

Step 2. Launch the Arduino application

Step 3. Add ESP32 board package to your Arduino IDE (ARDUINO UNO. NANO, AND MEGA..)

Navigate to File > Preferences, and fill "Additional Boards Manager URLs" with the url below: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

Navigate to Tools > Board > Boards Manager..., type the keyword "esp32" in the search box, select the latest version of esp32, and install it.

Step 4. Select your board and port
```

### Accessing EasyEDA
```
step 1. Navigate to https://easyeda.com/editor
step 2. click new project and create an account
step 3. click new project again if necessary, name your project and hit save.
step 4. now you can start designing your PCB!
```

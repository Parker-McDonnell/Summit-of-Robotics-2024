# PCB Design Workshop

We will provide an overview of key techniques in PCB design and fabrication, from selecting suitable electrical components to best practices in soldering and measuring in on-load assembly. Participants will explore how to design a functional antenna and build a controller, and some other hands-on applications as practical examples. The hands-on activity will guide attendees through the creation of a simple PCB circuit, including the design, soldering, and testing processes. The workshop will conclude with a demonstration of the antenna and controller in action.

## Setup

### Installing Arduino IDE

```
Step 1. Download and Install the latest version of Arduino IDE according to your operating system

Step 2. Launch the Arduino application

Step 3. Add ESP32 board package to your Arduino IDE

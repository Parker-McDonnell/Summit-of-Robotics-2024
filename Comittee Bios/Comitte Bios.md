  Howdy nerds! ü§†  
  I'm a second-year PhD student from CU Boulder. I spend most of my week working in the Animal Inspired Movement and Robotics Laboratory (AIMRL) on main campus, where I work with insect-scale robots. My research focus is in controls and autonomy, but I also enjoy dabbling in hardware and mechanics!  
  Have you ever noticed that fireflies (aka lightning bugs) are somewhat scarce in Colorado? I have! I am working with a CS lab on east campus to study these fragile fairies of the insect world. I've written a lot of useful code that allows researchers to observe and interact with various species of fireflies using a tiny quadcopter that fits in the palm of your hand.  
  Fireflies are quite rare in Colorado due to destruction of habitat, pesticides, and other human activities. I miss the massive, magical swarms of fireflies that illuminate the night skies back in Ohio!  
  Speaking of Ohio... That's my home state (I swear, it's a real place üòÖ)! I also did my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering there through Sinclair Community College and Wright State University. My degree track focused on materials and design, and I landed a two-year internship at the Air Force Research Lab. My research there was focused on novel additive manufacturing processes for laser-powder-bed-fusion techniques. That's also when I really started writing a LOT of code, and my advisor there pushed me to think about grad school. So here I am!  
  I also enjoy sharing my passion for robotics with others, especially kids! I helped teach an intro course offered by my library for programming and arduino-based robotics all the way back in my high school days. More recently, I made a few trips out to Pagosa Springs High School to teach teens about air quality monitoring and to mentor them as they designed and ran their own experiments using monitoring devices developed here at CU!

Hi! Want to learn more about the planning comittee members? Here you go!


# Lucas Duncan üêú+ü§ñ
  Howdy nerds! ü§†  
  I'm a second-year PhD student from CU Boulder. I spend most of my week working in the Animal Inspired Movement and Robotics Laboratory (AIMRL) on main campus, where I work with insect-scale robots. My research focus is in controls and autonomy, but I also enjoy dabbling in hardware and mechanics!  
  Have you ever noticed that fireflies (aka lightning bugs) are somewhat scarce in Colorado? I have! I am working with a CS lab on east campus to study these fragile fairies of the insect world. I've written a lot of useful code that allows researchers to observe and interact with various species of fireflies using a tiny quadcopter that fits in the palm of your hand.  
  Fireflies are quite rare in Colorado due to destruction of habitat, pesticides, and other human activities. I miss the massive, magical swarms of fireflies that illuminate the night skies back in Ohio! Hopefully, my work will contribute to conservation efforts here in CO.  
  Speaking of Ohio... That's my home state (I swear, it's a real place üòÖ)! I also did my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering there through Sinclair Community College and Wright State University. My degree track focused on materials and design, and I landed a two-year internship at the Air Force Research Lab. My research there was focused on novel additive manufacturing processes for laser-powder-bed-fusion techniques. That's also when I really started writing a LOT of code, and my advisor there pushed me to think about grad school. So here I am!  
  I also enjoy sharing my passion for robotics with others, especially kids! I helped teach an intro course offered by my library for programming and arduino-based robotics all the way back in my high school days. More recently, I made a few trips out to Pagosa Springs High School to teach teens about air quality monitoring and to mentor them as they designed and ran their own experiments using monitoring devices developed here at CU!

# Angie Volchko
I'm a 6th year PhD student in the Bio-Inspired Perception and Robotics Lab (BPRL ü™∞) studying control theory and soft robots üêô. 
However, I didn't know too much about robots prior to graduate school, and ended up here simply following my passion for math and control systems engineering. 

I have had a lot of amazing leadership opportunities during my time here at CU, from leading the graduate recruitment event for the mechanical engineering department, to helping allocate nearly $500,000 a year to inspire students and faculty to help innovate ways to improve the engineering education here at CU,
to instructing the undergraduate dynamics course in the mechanical engineering department this fall.

I strive to help build community wherever I go, and that's why I am really excited for this retreat. 
To give you an example, I spent some of my undergraduate as the president of the longboarding club at Ohio State, 
growing a 3-person weekly hangout to a consistent 30 member club, and I am happy to say that club is still going strong with similarly large weekly turnouts to this day (7 years later) (https://www.instagram.com/osulongboardclub/).
I love the community aspect of the research world here at CU Boulder and am really excited to make it even stronger.

# James Watson
I'm a 6th year PhD student in the Correll Lab studying Open-World Planning Under Uncertainty. 
Prior to my PhD work, my background covered Mechanical Engineering (BS @ UIUC, MS @ U of Utah), Nuclear Power (Systems Engineer), and Diesel-Generator Technology (Lead Test Engineer).

While at CU, I have had the honor of studying symbolic planning for NASA, desert habitat restoration for NSF, and placing 2nd in international robotic manipulation competition at IROS in Macao!  It's been quite a ride, and I hope to leverage my experience in the rapidly-expanding research and development of Robotic Precision Agriculture.

In my (scarce) spare time I enjoy sewing, hiking, and computer graphics.
